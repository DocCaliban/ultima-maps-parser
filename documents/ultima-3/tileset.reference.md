# Tileset Reference


This table lists every tile found in either SHAPES.ULT or shapes.ega, along with its name and corresponding tile number (hex offset).

You may have seen references to 50 or 64 tiles elsewhere, but those numbers don’t reflect the complete picture. The tileset actually contains 80 unique entries. 64 serve as the core tiles, while the extra 16 provide second-frame animations for select tiles. Below is the full breakdown.
